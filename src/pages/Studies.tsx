      <h1>Summary of my skills and studies</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>I am curerently on <strong>fourth year</strong> of computer science degree. Of my studies, <strong>Little under 2 years is left (9.9.2024).</strong> I am looking for junior position which I could start right away if I was offered one!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I am capable at <strong>backend</strong> developping and familiar both with NoSQL and SQL databases. I have only used Node.js, but if some other framework like Springboot (Java) or Flask (Python) is used I am confident that I could adapt</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With <strong>frontend</strong> I have mostly used React. I have spend little time on other frameworks like vue and on vanilla Js + HTML + CSS, but not much.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Other usefull skills are GIT usage, deploying (Render, Heroku), Containerization (Docker) and CI/CD stuff (github actions). These tree points combined is called <strong>Full stac development!</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Perhaps it is because of my maths backround, but I love <strong>datastructures and algorithms</strong> which I have done bunch with c++. Unfortunately those skills not seem to be usefull that often.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Embedded systems</strong> is my secondary subject. I know popular languages related like C++, C and Rust. I have not done any related projects and I have completed only couple of related courses so I need time before I am truly capable</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
