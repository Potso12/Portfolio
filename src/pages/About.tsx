                    In my youth I always was active person both in sports and in schoool related activities.
                    I was always representing my class in Student Union. At all times I was also playing at
                    least on team hobby. I was most competitive in floorball, but football, icehockey and frisbeegolf
                    were also in the picture. If you asked my family how I am like they would propably describe me as
                    active person. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays none of those hobbies are part of my life anymore. I dont want to abandon sport althogether
                    so I go to gym and play badminton occasionally. However since I study, work as an assitant teacher in
                    course that teaches c++ and have other part time job I don't have currently much free time. I just focus
                    on my studies and go couple of times a week to work. I work as a door to door salesman and I am actually
                    quite happy with my job, but would be even happier with my first ever computer science related job. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was always good in maths and that what I ended up studying it in university. I did't like how 
                    unpractical it was and after first programming course I fell in love with it and switced my degree to
                    computer science. I am at start fourth year and starting my masters degree now. I have used many 
                    languages like C, C++, java, python and javaScript for example. Mostly it has been javaScipt and 
                    C++ when it is not related to webdevelopping. I am most capable with fuls stack web development, 
                    but also know About datastructures and algorithms and embedded systems for example.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked in many jobs that are not field related like cleaner and on different salesman positions. 
                    But now I feel like I am ready to take my first software development job. I am mainly looking for 
                    junior position in web development, but I have capabilities in other areas too. I am ready to work along with 
                    my studies or to start as a summer employee and possibly stay as part time worker.
